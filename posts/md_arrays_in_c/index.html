So this means the compiler will treat the 2D array matrix[3][3] as a 1D array if you don’t explicitly tell the compiler to treat it like a 2D one. (might be confusing but I’ll explain it with examples) the difference between static allocated array and dynamic allocated array in C: an online IDE with compiler that might come in handy: jdoodle C What’s the Issue? Let’s understand the problem first, here’s a C code snippet with bugs.\nDon’t worry what does the convert_to_csr do. You just need to focus on its arguments.\n#include void convert_to_csr(int **matrix, size_t row_len, size_t col_len){ printf(\"first value of array %d\\n\", **matrix); } int main(void) { int matrix[3][3] = { {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0} }; printf(\"matrix first value outside func %d\\n\", matrix[0][0]); convert_to_csr(matrix, 3, 3); } Simply copy and paste it to the jdoodle online C compiler and run it. A error will pop-up like Command terminated by signal 11 which aka SIGSEGV. The error appears when a program or code tries to access an invalid memory location.\nWhy SIGSEGV Happens? Now let’s break down these different kinds of “pointers” in C to understand the problem:\nA Normal Pointer (like int*): int* ptr: A pointer in C is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. Size of a pointer jump: ptr++ in int *ptr moves the pointer by sizeof(int) bytes. Array Name: int arr[5]: in this case arr is not exactly a 100% pointer. As this “pointer” does not allow the increment operation (++). This is because arrays are not modifiable l-values in C. However, you can use a new pointer int* ptr = arr as in C, the name of an array can be used as a pointer to its first element. Size of a pointer jump: ptr++ in this case moves the pointer by sizeof(int) bytes; And if it’s a 2D array int arr[5][5]: Then the first element is an int[5] array, so a pointerizion in this case should be: int (*ptr)[5] = arr. Size of a pointer jump: ptr++ in this case moves the pointer by 5 * sizeof(int) bytes. A Pointer to Pointer: int ** ptr: A pointer to pointer in C is a variable that holds the memory address of another pointer. Size of a pointer jump: ptr++ in int **ptr moves the pointer by sizeof(int*) bytes aka a poniter’s size. So The function convert_to_csr is expecting a parameter of type int**, which is a pointer to a pointer to an int. This is fundamentally different from int (*)[3] in terms of memory layout and how the pointer arithmetic works. That’s why the error has been thrown.\nI know it might be confusing, lets come back to this “a static array (whatever how many dimensions it is) in C is stored contiguously in memory” and “the compiler will treat the 2D array matrix[3][3] as a 1D array if you don’t explicitly tell the compiler to treat it like a 2D one”.\nHere’s a perfect example to explain everything, please run the following code:\n#include int main(void) { int matrix[3][3] = { {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0} }; int **ptr1 = matrix; int (*ptr2)[3] = matrix; printf(\"ptr1: %p\\n\", ptr1); printf(\"ptr2: %p\\n\", ptr2); printf(\"*ptr1: %p\\n\", *ptr1); printf(\"*ptr2: %p\\n\", *ptr2); return 0; } You can get the output like:\nptr1: 0x7ffe5261a090 ptr2: 0x7ffe5261a090 *ptr1: 0x100000000 *ptr2: 0x7ffe5261a090 Your ptr1, ptr2,and *ptr2 might be different than mine (as we run on different machine) but the third line *ptr1: 0x100000000 should be the same and it doesn’t looks like an actual address at all.\nThis is what I mean by “the compiler treat it like a 1D array if you don’t tell it”. So when you dereference ptr1 using *ptr1, you’re treating the value at matrix[0][0] as a pointer (since ptr1 is an int**). This is why you get a strange and seemingly unrelated memory address, like 0x100000000. It’s interpreting the integer value at matrix[0][0] (which is 0) as a memory address, leading to a sig fault.\nPlease notice that operation like int **ptr1 = matrix; is actually problematic and should not compile without a warning or error in standard C. ptr1 is a pointer to a pointer to an int, but matrix is a 2D array (specifically, an array of arrays of int). In C, these are not compatible types, as the memory layout they expect is different. If your compiler allows this assignment, it’s doing so without proper type checking, which is unsafe.\nint ** arr is typically used for a dynamically allocated 2D array (malloc()) where each row is an independently allocated array of integers, and arr points to an array of pointers, each pointing to one of these rows.\nWhat’s the Solutions? One solution in C for passing 2D or multi-dimensional array as paramenter is using void* pointer.\nBut please be careful because void* pointers lack any information about the type they point to, like the pointered-to variable’s size. So when working with void* pointers, you have to explicitly manage the pointer arithmetic and type casting.\nAn example using void* in this case is:\n#include void convert_to_csr(void *matrix, size_t row_len, size_t col_len){ // Cast the void pointer to the correct type, which is a pointer to an array of int[col_len] int (*mat)[col_len] = matrix; // Now, mat can be used as a 2D array // Some 2D array accessing operations for (size_t i = 0; i \u003c row_len; ++i) { for (size_t j = 0; j \u003c col_len; ++j) { printf(\"%d \", mat[i][j]); } printf(\"\\n\"); } } int main(void) { int matrix[3][3] = { {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0} }; printf(\"Matrix first value outside func: %d\\n\", matrix[0][0]); // Passing the matrix as a void pointer convert_to_csr(matrix, 3, 3); return 0; } This void* approach could be confusing though.\nOr this will work as well, but it uses some magic number in convert_to_csr declaration so I don’t really like it.\n#include #include void convert_to_csr(int (*matrix)[3], size_t row_len, size_t col_len) { // Example: Print elements to demonstrate correct access for (size_t i = 0; i \u003c row_len; i++) { for (size_t j = 0; j \u003c col_len; j++) { printf(\"%d \", matrix[i][j]); } printf(\"\\n\"); } } int main(void) { int matrix[3][3] = { {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0} }; printf(\"Matrix first value outside func: %d\\n\", matrix[0][0]); convert_to_csr(matrix, 3, 3); return 0; } Or if your compiler supports variable length arrays then you can declare the convert_to_csr function like:\n#include void convert_to_csr(size_t row_len, size_t col_len, int matrix[row_len][col_len]){ for (size_t i = 0; i \u003c row_len; i++) { for (size_t j = 0; j \u003c col_len; j++) { printf(\"%d \", matrix[i][j]); } printf(\"\\n\"); } } int main(void) { int matrix[3][3] = { {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0} }; printf(\"matrix first value outside func %d\\n\", matrix[0][0]); convert_to_csr(3, 3, matrix); } This is a cleaner and more straightforward way of handling arrays of varying sizes in C, provided that the compiler supports C99 or later standards.\nLast Talking Cock: If you understand the pointers and mutidimentional arrays in C, you already A MASTER OF C! 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻\nLol but honestly, in C there’s not necessary many cool stuffs (like vector in C++ or GC in Java). That why you might find C usually under the shadow of C++🥲.\nEven though, I reckon that understanding that Memory Allocation stuff is critical for learning whatever kinds of programming languages. It’s not just the language but the mindset as a programmer.\nFor an advanced understanding of C, computer architecture, compilation principle and even a bit linux system kernel, please have a look at CMU 15-213: CSAPP. It’s not easy, but no cap that it’s my first inspired course in computer science study jounery. It indeed cooked most of the fundamentals you need to know in computer science. Its reputation is well deserived🙂.\nSome References: GeeksforGeeks: lvalue and rvalue in C language CppReference: C99 variable length arrays CMU 15-213: CSAPP ","wordCount":"1440","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://jrmh.dev/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2023-12-29T18:10:00+11:00","dateModified":"2023-12-29T18:10:00+11:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeremiah Hsing"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://jrmh.dev/posts/md_arrays_in_c/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jeremiah's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://jrmh.dev/icons/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://jrmh.dev/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://jrmh.dev/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jrmh.dev/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jrmh.dev/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jrmh.dev/archives/ title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://jrmh.dev/editors-picks/ title="Editor's Picks"><span>Editor's Picks</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://jrmh.dev/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://jrmh.dev/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Multidimensional Arrays and Pointers in C</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-12-29 18:10:00 +1100 +1100'>29 December, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1440 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jeremiah Hsing&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/JeremiahXing/blog/tree/main/content/posts/md_arrays_in_c/index.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>edit 🖋️</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Multi-dimensional arrays in C can be somewhat confusing, especially when it comes to pointers and memory layout.

*ptr1: 0x100000000
*ptr2: 0x7ffe5261a090
</code></pre><p>Your <code>ptr1</code>, <code>ptr2</code>,and <code>*ptr2</code> might be different than mine (as we run on different machine) but the third line <code>*ptr1: 0x100000000</code> should be the same and it doesn&rsquo;t looks like an actual address at all.</p><p>This is what I mean by &ldquo;the compiler treat it like a 1D array if you don&rsquo;t tell it&rdquo;. So when you dereference <code>ptr1</code> using <code>*ptr1</code>, you&rsquo;re treating the value at <code>matrix[0][0]</code> as a pointer (since <code>ptr1</code> is an <code>int**</code>). This is why you get a strange and seemingly unrelated memory address, like <code>0x100000000</code>. It&rsquo;s interpreting the integer value at <code>matrix[0][0]</code> (which is <code>0</code>) as a memory address, leading to a sig fault.</p><p>Please notice that operation like <code>int **ptr1 = matrix;</code> is actually problematic and should not compile without a warning or error in standard C. <code>ptr1</code> is a pointer to a pointer to an int, but <code>matrix</code> is a 2D array (specifically, an array of arrays of int). In C, these are not compatible types, as the memory layout they expect is different. If your compiler allows this assignment, it&rsquo;s doing so without proper type checking, which is unsafe.</p><p><code>int ** arr</code> is typically used for a dynamically allocated 2D array (<code>malloc()</code>) where each row is an independently allocated array of integers, and <code>arr</code> points to an array of pointers, each pointing to one of these rows.</p><h3 id=whats-the-solutions>What&rsquo;s the Solutions?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whats-the-solutions>#</a></h3><p>One solution in C for passing 2D or multi-dimensional array as paramenter is using <code>void*</code> pointer.</p><p>But please be careful because <code>void*</code> pointers lack any information about the type they point to, like the pointered-to variable&rsquo;s size. So when working with <code>void*</code> pointers, you have to explicitly manage the pointer arithmetic and type casting.</p><p>An example using <code>void*</code> in this case is:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=cp>#include</span><span class=cpf>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class=cp>
